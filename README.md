# Technical Test for Applied Scientist (Data Scientist)

__Opportunity No. 44081__

## Overview

This test is used to evaluate your technical ability and proficiency in writing code and modelling business problems. We will review not only your output, but also the process that you used to arrive at your solution. 

> [!NOTE]
> The problem presented here is representative of the __typical__ problem we solve. In the interest of fairness and out of respect for your time, a relatively simple problem has been chosen. In practice, the problems we solve are more complex.


> [!CAUTION]
> If you choose to use an AI tool to prepare your submission, you must disclose what tool and how you used it. Submissions that fail to disclose their use of AI will be disqualified. 


## Challenge

For this exercise, you will use data from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. This dataset is related to [ferry tickets](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-island-ferry-ticket-counts/) for the Toronto Island Park ferry service.

We have built a simple forecasting model that uses this data predicts the number of redemptions (i.e., people getting on the ferry) at any given time. 

Your task is to:

1. Improve the first forecasting model for redemptions. (30% of points)
2. Create another forecasting model for the number of sales (i.e., people buying tickets). (30% of points)

*How you go about the task is as important as your model performance* and we are paying attention to your process. You will see some template code has already been started in the repository. You should use this code and built off it with proper development workflows - as if you are collaborating with a colleague (30% of points).

Finally, you should prepare a short summary of what you did, why it is better than what we provided, and how you have approached the business problem (10% of points). You should provide an accessible summary of your work in bullet points and plain language, as well as a more detailed description in standard prose. Total words for each summary should not exceed 500.

## Expected Outcomes

- An improved forecasting model for redemptions.
- A forecasting model for sales.
- Accessible description of the work (bullet points) for a non-technical client,  not exceeding 500 words.
- A more detailed description of the work with technical specifics that does not exceed 500 words.

## Submission

Provide a link to the completed modelling exercise on a GitHub account. You can choose to keep the repository private or public. If it is private, you must share your repository with the [gom-ta GitHub account](https://github.com/gom-ta).
